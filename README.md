AdaBrain-Bench provides code for evaluating EEG foundation models across **13 datasets and 7 tasks**, covering **cognitive state assessment, human augmentation, and clinical monitoring**. It supports diverse task paradigms, including **classification, regression, and retrieval**, with comprehensive evaluation metrics. Additionally, it employs multifaceted evaluation settings including **cross-subject, multi-subject, and few-shot setting** to thoroughly assess models downstream task generalization ability in various scenarios.

The code is coming soon...
